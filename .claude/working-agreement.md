# Working agreement — how the agent works here

Read before doing anything. This governs how any AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, …)
works in this repo.

## 1. The five-step protocol — Explore → Plan → Confirm → Implement → Verify

Every unit of work runs these five. **Confirm is a human checkpoint: wait for an
explicit "go" before editing files or running commands.**

- **Explore** — read-only; understand the code before proposing.
- **Plan** — write the task contract (`.claude/task/contract.md`).
- **Confirm** — state the plan back and WAIT for the user's go. Use plan mode so the
  harness enforces the wait. Weighing options or "what should I do?" is **not** a go.
- **Implement** — edit only files inside the contract's `scope_paths`.
- **Verify** — meet `done_when`, run the review cycle, then commit.

Exploring tradeoffs or being asked a question is not permission to change the repo.
Answer, recommend, then wait. When unsure, ask one short question instead of acting.
At the end of a session, update `.claude/active_work.md` so the next one continues cleanly.

## 2. The task contract + review cycle

Before a non-trivial change, write `.claude/task/contract.md` (template:
`CONTRACT_TEMPLATE.md`): objective, `scope_paths` (the files this task may touch),
`decisions_reserved` (owner-only questions — §6), `done_when`. Commit it with the
branch so it is visible in the PR. The scope-auditor reviewer flags any edit outside
`scope_paths` at review time.

Before committing, run the review cycle (the commit gate enforces it):

1. Stage everything (`git add`).
2. Run the reviewers the routing requires (`.claude/review_routing.json`) against the
   staged diff — cold, read-only, adversarial.
3. Write `.claude/task/review.md` (template: `REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md`) with each reviewer's
   verdict and the staged-diff hash.
4. `git commit` — blocked until the review matches the staged change, every required
   reviewer passed, and any escalation has a recorded answer.

Trace before you change a shared data model: know what depends on it downstream first.

## 3. Branches

Every change goes on a new branch — never commit or push to `main`. Push with an explicit
refspec (`git push origin <branch>`), open a PR, wait for CI + the user's approval.
**Never run `gh pr merge`** — merging is the user's action. Before branching, check
`gh pr list --state open`: if the work is a hard dependency of an open PR and a separate
branch buys nothing, commit to that branch instead.

This is **hook-enforced**: a commit or push while on `main`/`master`, `gh pr merge`, and
`git commit --amend`/`--no-verify` are all hard-blocked.

## 4. Quality

- **No hacky solutions.** If the clean way takes longer, say so — don't ship a workaround
  and call it done.
- **No unnecessary complexity.** Three clear lines beat a premature abstraction.
- **No scope creep.** Build exactly what was agreed; flag adjacent issues separately.
- **No half-finished work.** If it can't be done cleanly, say so before starting.
- **Tests are non-negotiable.** Output you can't eyeball must be covered by automated
  tests that run in CI.

## 5. Don't work against the user

- Never weaken config, scope, or cost/safety limits to "unblock" or finish faster without
  explicit confirmation in the same thread.
- Never silently narrow scope (doing part while implying the whole).
- When something blocks you, say so clearly and point at the relevant doc.

## 6. Decision rights — what the agent never decides alone

Each is the owner's call, escalated (§7) every time, however obvious it seems:

- Product/UX content, composition, ordering.
- Metric definitions, labels, formats; user-visible naming and wording.
- Anything permanent once published (URLs, slugs, public identifiers).
- A NEW mechanism (new dependency, service, lifecycle hook, framework, workflow step).
- Reinterpreting or extending a rule to a case it didn't cover.
- Changing an already-shipped output or number.
- Cost, schedule, scope (budget, run cadence, widening a task).

Agent-executable = implementation already codified in a contract or standards doc.
**Meta-rule:** when a new case doesn't clearly match a written rule, the classification
itself is the owner's decision. "It's analogous to X" is not a licence.

## 7. Escalation

Before escalating, check your premises: list the assumptions behind the question and drop
any the written rules already answer. Then present **at least two conflicting paths with no
preferred option** — for each, what it implies, what it costs, what becomes hard later.
The owner decides; you inform.

## 8. Communication

Plain language, technically accurate. No filler, no motivational text, no emoji unless
asked. Backticks for files/functions/columns. Proposals proportional to the request. When
something goes wrong, say what happened, why, and the fix — don't bury it.

## Anti-patterns to hunt (extend with your own)

- Inventing or redefining a metric without approval.
- Presenting a product decision as if it were agreed.
- Over-extending a rule, or adding a mechanism unilaterally to satisfy a tool.
- Doing real logic in the consumption/frontend layer instead of upstream.
- Spot-fixing a data bug one layer at a time without the end-to-end picture; narrowing
  coverage to make a test pass; asserting before measuring.
