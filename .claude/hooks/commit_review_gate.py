"""PreToolUse(Bash) -- block a commit until the change has been reviewed.

The blinded review gate. When you run `git commit`, this:
  1. hashes the CUMULATIVE diff -- everything already committed on this branch
     since it split from the base branch (main/master, local or remote),
     PLUS what's currently staged -- not just the staged diff alone. A
     multi-commit branch's review must cover the whole branch, not silently
     just its last increment; this also matches what scope-auditor.md says
     its input is ("the cumulative branch diff vs the base branch").
  2. works out which reviewers are required for the changed files
     (.claude/review_routing.json in the project),
  3. reads .claude/task/review.md and BLOCKS the commit unless:
       - the recorded diff_sha256 matches the cumulative diff (so the review
         covers exactly what the branch will contain after this commit),
       - every required reviewer has a verdict and none is FAIL,
       - every ESCALATE has a recorded "CPO ANSWER:",
       - if review.md's optional `rounds:` counter exceeds a cap, a recorded
         "CPO ANSWER:" is present somewhere -- forces escalation to the owner
         instead of an unbounded reviewer back-and-forth. `rounds:` is
         SELF-REPORTED (whoever re-reviews increments it) -- the hook enforces
         the cap once recorded, it doesn't independently derive the count.
A commit is exempt when the branch's whole cumulative diff touches only
bookkeeping files (.claude/task/**, active_work.md). Fails OPEN on any error -- a gate bug must never block your workflow.

Wired in .claude/settings.json as:
  python "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/commit_review_gate.py"
Run with a trailing --diff-hash to print the diff hash for review.md
(--staged-hash also accepted, for anything already using that name).
