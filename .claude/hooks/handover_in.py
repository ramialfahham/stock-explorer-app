"""SessionStart guardrail -- inject the project's active-work handover.

PORTABLE / generic: no project-specific paths. On every session start, reads
``<project>/.claude/active_work.md`` and injects it into the new chat so a fresh
agent continues from the exact documented state instead of re-deriving it from a
thin issue title or a long memory file (which is how scoped work gets silently
re-scoped). If the handover file is missing, says so explicitly.

Fails open on any error (no output, exit 0).
