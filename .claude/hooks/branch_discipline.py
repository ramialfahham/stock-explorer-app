"""PreToolUse(Bash) guardrail -- branch discipline (hard enforcement).

Self-gated to the actual command. Hard-blocks the shortcuts so the
new-branch -> PR -> user-merges workflow is enforced, not just advised:

  1. `git commit` while on `main`/`master`  -> blocked: branch first.
  2. `git push` of the `main`/`master` branch -> blocked: push a feature branch.
  3. `gh pr merge`                           -> blocked: the user merges, not the agent.
  4. `git commit --amend` / `--no-verify` / `-n` -> blocked: history stays
     append-only and hook-verified.
  5. `git commit` with any flag not on the allowlist, or a pathspec argument
     -> blocked: a bundled `-am` or `commit <file>` silently commits changes
     the review gate's hash never covered.
  6. A single Bash command bundling an index-mutating subcommand (`add`,
     `rm`, `mv`, `reset`, `restore`, `stage`, `checkout`) with `commit`
     -> blocked: staging and committing must be separate tool calls, so the
     review gate's pre-check always reflects the real staged state at commit
     time (`git add extra-file && git commit` would otherwise let a smaller,
     already-reviewed diff be the one hashed while a larger one gets committed).

Fails OPEN: a non-matching command exits 0 with no output; an unexpected error
exits non-zero with a traceback, which Claude Code treats as non-blocking.

    command, or None. Checked across ALL simple-commands in one invocation --
    see reason 6 in the module docstring.

    `checkout` is special-cased, narrowly: `git checkout -b/-B <branch>`
    (branch creation) is exempted -- that flag can only create/reset a branch,
    never restore file content, so it's unambiguously safe regardless of what
    follows it. Nothing else about `checkout` is exempted: `git checkout
    <ref> <path>` restores file content into the index/working tree WITHOUT
    requiring `--` (`--` only disambiguates a path that could also be read as
    a branch name; git accepts the bare form) -- a token-level check can't
    reliably tell "<ref> <path>" apart from a plain branch switch the way git
    itself does (by checking the working tree), so anything other than the
    `-b`/`-B` form is treated conservatively as index-mutating. A rare, benign
    `git checkout <existing-branch> && git commit` bundle gets forced into two
    calls too -- the safe direction to be wrong in.

    Uses `is_commit_subcommand` (shared with commit_review_gate),
    not a bare `git_subcommand(...) == "commit"` check -- `git commit
    --dry-run` commits nothing, so `git add -A && git commit --dry-run` must
    not be blocked; an earlier version of this function used the bare check
